Particle Personality

My personality I picked was someone who ate something and has an allergic reaction to it. 

My initial idea was to the environment as if we were looking inside the body and having a foreign object fall and infecting the cells to react in a frantic behaviour and taking over the body. 

However, things did not go my way. Instead of having a calm initial start, my concept kind of started go towards an explosive approach. 
Some of my main concept were there such as the foreign object which is the orange ball and being inside the body. 
The particle system is the blue/white cells and we slowly see little reactions creeping around and then suddenly taking over the body. 

I wanted to follow the theme of invasion and overpowering. Where the reaction kind of takes over your body with hives and itchiness and feeling uncomfortable. 


I used these two sites to use inspiration from, aesthetically and technically.
