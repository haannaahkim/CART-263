Data Visualization: Honey Production in the US in 2010
by Hannah Kim


|| Original Idea||

For this project, I originally wanted to use a different data set. I wanted to use a data that was personal to me, my family owns a flower shop and last month it was Valentine's Day. I wanted to compare the sales from this year to the previous years, but my family was not comfortable exposing that much information so I had to change my idea quick.

|| Final Idea||

I was looking through some data set that I thought it would be nice to represent aesthetically but also easy to understnad. I was able to find the honey production data and I thought it was a cute idea and which I decided to continue with it. My idea was to create multiple honeycombs and represent the number of production from each different state.

||Coding Process ||

I definitely had a hard time coding the hexagons, and I had to use a reference from the internet to help. I also had a lot of difficulty displaying my data, by using dist to calculate my distance from my mouse to display the production number.

How I organized my data was through the catergory 'productions' and 'average price'. The size were decided based on the x number of production and the way that the hexagons were displayed, was if the price was higher, the hexagon would be placed on top and if number is lower, it would be placed at the bottom. When put all together it looks like a graph but inside a honeycomb.

I also thought adding little bee illustrations was a nice touch instead of a static screen, I thoguht it felt more interactive and dynamic to the project. 

||Final Thoughts ||

I am happy with how it came out, it was definitely a process and it could have been a lot worse but I thought it came out pretty good. 

If I had more time I would've liked to add the name of the states of each hexagon to show which state did x amount of production.
